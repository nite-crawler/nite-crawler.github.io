                  Henna has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I started my journey in my early teenage years, doodling simple curvy lines on my own hands and those of my friends. What began as a playful pastime quickly became something much deeper, an art form that connected me to my culture, creativity, and a sense of calm.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the years, those simple lines have grown into intricate designs, each pattern telling a story. Every swirl, dot, and petal I draw is a reflection of my love for this craft. Henna is more than just decoration for me, it's a way to celebrate moments, bring smiles, and share a tradition that has been cherished for generations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, I'm grateful to turn this passion into my work, creating designs that range from delicate and minimal to bold and elaborate. Whether it's for a wedding, a festival, or just because, I pour my heart into every stain, making sure each one feels special.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Henna isn't just something I do, it's a part of who I am.
